Angela McLaughlin is a postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Finlay Maguire’s lab at Dalhousie University, in collaboration with Dr. Zvonimir Poljak at University of Guelph. Her research interests span viral phylogenetics (HIV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and influenza virus), genomic epidemiology, bioinformatics, public health, wildlife surveillance, and statistical/machine learning/mathematical models of pathogen transmission. Her current project aims to predict host specificity of avian influenza virus H5Nx using machine learning models of viral genomic features with phylogenetics-informed cross-validation and hierarchical segment to whole genome ensemble models.

> --- iolawoye@uwo.ca

Idowu is a postdoctoral associate in the Guthrie Lab at the University of Western Ontario. His research focuses on utilizing computational biology to understand transmission patterns, genomic evolution, and antimicrobial resistance of bacterial pathogens. He has been involved in numerous bioinformatics workshops and trainings across Africa and most recently in Canada.

#### Jennifer Guthrie
